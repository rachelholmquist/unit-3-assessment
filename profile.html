	<h1>My Career Goals:</h1>
	<p id="career">My interest in web development started way back in the myspace days. I would spend hours changing
		the html on my profile to see what different things would do when changed and research new stuff I could add.
		I've always had an interest in the design of websites but never really looked further into it. I have been a stay
		at home mom since my daughter was born in June 2021 and I knew I didn't want to do this forever, but I wanted to have 
		a career I could start when I decided to go back to work. I hope to become a front end web developer in the next year.
